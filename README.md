# A short primer to markdown syntax ! :dizzy:

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add
formatting to plaintext text documents. Markdown is one of the most
popular markup languages.

Markdown files (files with a `.md` extension) such as this README file
are automatically rendered by GitHub.

## Bold and italic text

* To render text **in bold**, surround it with `**` or `__`.  
  Example: `**this is important**` ---> **this is important**

* To render text _in italic_, surround it with `_` or `*`.  
  Example: `this is *really great*` ---> this is _really great_

## Titles

To create a title in markdown, add one (or more) `#` signs at the start
of the line:
* `#` = level 1 title (largest font).
* `##` = level 2 title.
* `###` = level 3 title.
* `####` = level 4 title.
* `#####` = level 5 title.
* `######` = level 6 title (smallest font).

Examples:
### This is a level 3 title...
##### This is a level 5 title...
